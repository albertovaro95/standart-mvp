- Look at relevant context_session_file and code files to understand current and needed implementation

## Step 2: Draft Issue
Create an issue with this structure:

### Problem Statement
What problem does this solve? What are current limitations?

### User Value
What specific benefits will users get? Give concrete examples.

### Definition of Done
- Implementation complete with edge cases handled
- Unit tests added (>80% coverage)
  - Backend: pytest tests passing
  - Frontend: Vitest/Jest tests passing
- Integration tests for main flows
- Documentation updated
- Code review approved
- CI/CD passes
- Manual testing complete

### Manual Testing Checklist
- Basic flow: [specific steps]
- Edge case testing: [specific scenarios]
- Error handling: [error scenarios to test]
- Integration: [test with existing features]

## Step 3: Review
Show me the complete issue draft and ask: "Is this ready to create? Any changes needed?"

Wait for my approval.

## Step 4: Create Issue
After approval, use GitHub MCP:
```
mcp_github_create_issue(
  owner: "albertovaro95",
  repo: "standart-ai-development",
  title: "[Feature/bug/chore] YOUR_TITLE_HERE",
  body: "YOUR_ISSUE_CONTENT_HERE"
)
```

Tell me the issue number and URL when done.

## Remember
- Check actual code before suggesting solutions
- Use specific file names and paths
- Make testing steps concrete and actionable
- Focus on user benefits, not technical details
- Triage and use the correct term in the issue: it's a feature, a bug or a chore?
